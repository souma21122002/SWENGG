### **Justification: When to Use the Prototype Model?**  

The **Prototype Model** is best suited for:  

âœ… **Projects with Unclear or Evolving Requirements:**  
   - Useful when clients are **unsure about exact system functionalities**.  
   - The prototype helps refine the final requirements.  

âœ… **User-Centric Applications:**  
   - Ideal for **UI/UX-heavy applications**, where user feedback is critical.  
   - Examples: **Web applications, mobile apps, e-commerce platforms.**  

âœ… **Software with High Interaction Needs:**  
   - Best for applications where **usability and user interaction** play a major role.  
   - Examples: **Online booking systems, customer support portals.**  

âœ… **Experimental or Research-Based Projects:**  
   - Used when **trying new technologies** or **validating concepts** before full development.

### **Conclusion**  
The **Prototype Model** is ideal for projects where **requirements are uncertain or subject to change**. It ensures that the **final software aligns with user expectations** through continuous feedback and improvements. However, excessive iterations may lead to **higher development costs and time consumption**, making careful management essential.
